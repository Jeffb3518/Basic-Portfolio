		<strong>About Me</strong>
		</div>

		<div = class="me"><img src="assets/images/FullSizeRender2copy.jpg"></div>

		<p><span>I am originally from Erie, PA and relocated to Orlando, FL in 2010 upon graduation from college. I studied Criminal Justice at Gannon University and have several years experience investigating financial crimes both in the public and private sectors. Learning to code and web development have turned into a hobby that I hope in the near future will turn into my new career path. My interests include sports, fitness, cooking and anything involving friends and family.</span></p>
